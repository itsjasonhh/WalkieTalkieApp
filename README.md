# encrypt-server

Sever used to send and receive requests for encrypting audio

## Setup Virtual Environment
Setting up a virtual enviorment is a good idea in case we need to install
packages that are specific for the application
```
cd encrypt-server
virtualenv --system-site-packages -p python3 ./venv
source ./venv/bin/activiate
```

To exit out of virtual enviornment run the following command:
```
deactivate
```
